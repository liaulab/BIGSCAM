```
first install <sphinx> and <myst_parser>, i also added this to pyproject.toml so you can just install with that
```

```
run <sphinx-autobuild docs/source docs/build/html/> from terminal in ~/bigscam, and you'll get an automatically updating docs html file that you can view in your web browser.
